The project demonstrates how data analytics can track performance, detect bottlenecks, and measure the impact of process changes in parcel operations.

ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project models a parcel processing workflow across multiple mail centers from Aprilâ€“June 2025, including:

Parcel scan times and processing durations.

Missorted parcels and error types.

Delivery status (on-time vs late).

Impact of training new clerks and a layout optimization intervention.

Two dashboards were built to analyze and visualize KPIs:

Streamlit Dashboard â€“ Interactive, code-based.

Power BI Dashboard â€“ Drag-and-drop BI experience.

ðŸ“Š Key Features

Synthetic Dataset (angard_parcel_operations.csv) representing realistic parcel operations data.

Python KPI Script (analysis_kpis.py) to compare pre- vs post-intervention performance.

Streamlit Dashboard (app.py) with filters for date, center, and shift.

Power BI Report (PBIX not included here, but instructions provided) for no-code dashboarding.

Clear improvement trends in on-time rate and missort rate after intervention.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Streamlit.
